# Privacy Policy for SteamCmdPalExtension

#### This Privacy Policy describes how SteamCmdPalExtension ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the SteamCmdPalExtension (the "Extension"). Your privacy is important to us. This policy is intended to be transparent about our data practices and to comply with applicable privacy regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, relevant laws in North America (such as CCPA/CPRA in California and PIPEDA in Canada), and the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in China.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The Extension is designed to operate without collecting or processing any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Sensitive Personal Information (SPI). This includes, but is not limited to:
- Your name, email address, physical address, or phone number.
- Usernames, passwords, or other account credentials (except as necessary for the Extension to interact locally with your Steam client under your direct control and initiation, without transmitting this information to us).
- IP addresses that could be used to directly identify you.
- Geolocation data.
- Biometric data.
- Financial information.
- Health information.
- Any data from your Steam account, library, or activity that is transmitted to our servers or any third party, other than data processed locally on your device to provide the Extension's functionality.

### 2. Information We May Collect (Debugging Data)

To improve the functionality, stability, and user experience of the Extension, we may collect a limited amount of non-personally identifiable technical information for debugging and analytical purposes. This data may include:
- Anonymized error reports: If the Extension encounters an error, details about the error (e.g., stack trace, Extension version, operating system version) may be collected to help us diagnose and fix the issue. This information will be anonymized and will not contain any PII.
- Anonymized usage analytics: We may collect aggregated and anonymized data about how the Extension is used (e.g., frequently used commands, performance metrics like command execution time). This data is used to understand user needs and improve the Extension. It is not tied to any specific user.

Lawful Basis for Processing (GDPR): For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), our lawful basis for collecting and using the non-identifiable debugging and analytics information described above is our legitimate interest in maintaining and improving the Extension, provided that such interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

### 3. How We Use Information

Any non-identifiable debugging or analytical data collected will be used solely for the following purposes:
- To identify and resolve technical issues and bugs within the Extension.
- To understand usage patterns and improve the features and usability of the Extension.
- To monitor the performance and stability of the Extension.

### 4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties.
As stated, we do not collect PII. Any non-identifiable debugging or analytical data collected is for internal use only and will not be shared with third parties for their marketing or other independent purposes.

If we were to engage service providers for data analysis in the future (e.g., for processing anonymized crash reports), we would ensure they are contractually bound to protect the data and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.

### 5. External Services (Steam Client)

The Extension interacts directly with your locally installed Steam client to perform actions you initiate (e.g., launching games, searching your library or the store). These interactions are governed by Valve Corporation's Steam Privacy Policy. We do not control the data collection or privacy practices of Valve Corporation or the Steam client. We encourage you to review Steam's privacy policy for more information. The Extension itself does not transmit your Steam data to us or any other third party.

### 6. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect any data processed by the Extension. However, please note that no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. While we strive to use acceptable means to protect any potential debugging data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### 7. Data Retention

We will retain any non-identifiable debugging or analytical data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law.

### 8. Your Rights

Given that we do not collect PII, many data subject rights may not be directly applicable. However, we are committed to upholding privacy principles.
- For users in the EEA (under GDPR): You have rights including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and data portability concerning your personal data. As we do not collect personal data, these rights apply in a limited context. If you have concerns about potential debugging data, you can contact us.
- For users in California (under CCPA/CPRA): You have rights including the right to know, delete, and opt-out of the sale/sharing of personal information. We do not sell or share PII.
- For users in China (under PIPL): You have rights including access, correction, deletion, and consent withdrawal regarding your personal information. As we focus on non-PII debugging data, consent for PII processing is not sought through this policy for such data.
- For all users: If you have any questions or concerns about our data practices, please contact us. You can typically clear any locally cached data by the Extension through the Extension's settings or by reinstalling the Extension.

### 9. International Data Transfers

If any non-identifiable debugging data is processed or stored in a jurisdiction outside of your country of residence (e.g., if we use cloud services for analyzing crash reports), we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the data in accordance with applicable laws. Currently, all # processing initiated by the extension is local to your device or involves direct interaction with your local Steam client.

### 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension or on an associated website and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
